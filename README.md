# SoundTest (with Tailwind CSS)

This is a template for creating an audio web application powered by Elementary Audio for the sound engine and Angular for the GUI. The styles are implemented using Tailwind CSS.

## Done for you

* boilerplate implementation of Elementary's WebAudioRenderer and AudioContext
* a Notes utility object for instant access to any musical note you might want
* a button acting as a general audio on/off switch
* Tailwind CSS configuration

This way you can focus on building your audio app directly.

## How to build

Run `npm start` to build the app.
